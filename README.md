# myPortfolio
This is a portfolio website that I create for myself. It is the last project for the course Web design for everybody (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/web-design). I tried my best to implement most functions I know into it. It is a website created from a template. Surely I will create one from the scratch soon ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª
